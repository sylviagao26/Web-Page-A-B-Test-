# Web-Page-A-B-Test Analysis 
For this project, we will working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

We first clean the data and restructure it to be more friendly to analysis. Then conduct hypothesis test to use bootstrap mimic the distribution. We also try to build logistic regression model to analysis if the new page conversionrate is better than the old one,

In coclusion, there's no strong evidence show new page has higher conversion rate than the old one. Next we will suggest company try to improve the new page or run the test for longer time.
